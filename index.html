        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a dynamic language with variable types. Variables in JavaScript are not directly associated with any particular value type.</li>
          <li>Variables are containers that store values.</li>
          <li>Variables need to be given a name.</li>
          <li>JavaScript is case sensitive. This means that "myVariable" is not the same as "myvariable".</li>
          <li>Variables may hold values that have different data types.</li>
          <li>Some examples of data types that can be assigned to variables are: String, Number, Boolean, Array, and Object.</li>
          <li>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code.</li>
          <li>String: a sequence of text that requires a single or douoble quote mark at the begining and end to identify it.</li>
          <li>Number: numbers don't have quotes around them.</li>
          <li>Boolean: is a true/false value and the words "true" and "flase" are special keywords that don't need quote marks.</li>
          <li>Array: is a structure that allows you to store multiple values in a single reference.</li>
          <li>Object: can be anything. Everything in JavaScript is an object and can be stored in a variable.</li>
          <li>Operators: allow you to use a mathmatical symbol to produce a result based on two values or variables.</li>
          <li>Conditionals: Are code stuctures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A common form of this is the "if...else" statment.</li>
          <li>Functions: are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It is possible to define a body of code as a function that exicutes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly writing the same code</li>
          <li>Arguments: are bits of data that a function often needs to do it's job. Arguments go inside the paranthesis, separated by commas if there are more than one argument.</li>
          <li>Event Handlers: are code structures that listen foe activity in the browser. An example of an obvious event handler is the "click event" which i sfired by the browser when you click on something with your mouse.</li>
          <li>Null: is a special value in JavaScript that refers to the absense of a value.</li>
          <li></li>
